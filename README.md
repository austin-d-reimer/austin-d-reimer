# Austin Reimer

![Profile](img/profile.jpg)

Red River College BIT grad. I am seeking a job as a full-stack web developer or a software developer

I have a few programs and projects on both [GitHub](https://github.com/austin-d-reimer/), and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/austin-d-reimer).

## About Me

As a kid, I did not plan on being a software developer later in life; I originally wanted to be an electrician. While in high school, I learned practical skills are important to be a software developer, like HTML, jQuery, PHP, CSS, JavaScript from my Web Dev class. While completing my electrical major, I learned logic gates from using PLC and wiring relays for ‘and’, ‘or’, ‘nor’, ‘nand’ gates.

After I graduated high school, I realized that with Manitoba’s winter I should try to find a job that is indoors so I could avoid having to work outside in -30° weather. That turned out to be a great choice since I both enjoy programming and I am good at it.

Skills: AWS, CSS, C#, Firebase, Git, GitHub, GitLab, Golang, HTML5, Java, JavaScript, NoSQL, PHP, Python, React.js, Ruby, SCSS, SQL.
